<p>I am Motivated Current YEAR UP Application Development Student. I have been working on medical device assembly and programming.
  My entire life, I used to deconstruct every toy I had to figure out how and why they worked the way they did and then reassemble 
  them to full operation.It was When I pressed the play button on my first JavaScript tutorial on Scrimba.com, the spark I'd been 
  missing ignited. I have been on my way to my dream destination on the main highway ever since. Front-end web programming appeals 
  to all my interests; it combines creativity and problem-solving, allowing me to break the code better. I enjoy using responsive 
  design ideas and seeing how my web function. Learning new skills and programming languages, as well as problem-solving, are among 
  my talents.My skills include. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ReactJS.
